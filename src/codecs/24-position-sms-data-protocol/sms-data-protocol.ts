   *** Encoding
   To be able to compress 24 GPS data entries into one SMS (140 octets),
   the data is encoded extensively using bit fields.
   Data packet can be interpreted as a bit stream, where all bits are numbered as follows:
   Byte1: 0-7, Byte2: 8-15, Byte3: 16-24 etc..

   -- Bits in a byte are numbered starting from least significant bit. A field of 25 bits would consist of bits 0 to 24 where 0 is the least significant bit and bit 24 â€“ most significant bit.
